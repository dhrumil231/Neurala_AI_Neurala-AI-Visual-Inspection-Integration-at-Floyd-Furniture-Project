# Neurala_AI_Neurala-AI-Visual-Inspection-Integration-at-Floyd-Furniture-Project
Our project journey was meticulously structured, and here's a snapshot:

1) MS Project 1B & 2B: We developed detailed project plans using Microsoft Project. MS Project 1 laid the groundwork, while MS Project 2 refined the plan with a stronger emphasis on implementation specifics. Key aspects included defining project phases, communication strategies, and resource allocation. The project spanned multiple phases over an extended period.
1B: Built a 42-day WBS (Initiation → Planning → Procurement).
2B: Refined into a 162-day Agile hybrid schedule, with sprints for AI training and testing.
Key Skill: Hybrid methodology—combined Waterfall (for procurement) with Agile (for AI iterations). 

2) Project Charters 1A & 2A: These charters were instrumental in formally initiating the project and defining its scope, objectives, and stakeholder involvement. They ensured alignment among team members and stakeholders, setting a clear path for the project's execution. 

3) Case Study & Final Presentation: We culminated our project with a detailed case study and presentation, showcasing the entire project lifecycle, outcomes, and lessons learned. 

4) Execution & Jira Deployment
Real-world Jira Board: Managed 4 epics, 23 tasks, and subtasks:
NAI-4: Project Charter 1A.
NAI-23: MS Project 1B.
NAI-24: MS Project 2B.
Key Skill: Agile execution—sprint reviews with Neurala’s team ensured iterative improvements.
